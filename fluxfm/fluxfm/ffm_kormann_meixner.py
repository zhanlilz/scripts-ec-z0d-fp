    """Estimate roughness lengths based on Kormann-Meixner footprint model. 

    Estimate roughness length (z0) by relating power-law wind profile in
    Kormann & Meixner's footprint model (Kormann and Meixner, 2001) to log wind
    profile in Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. 

    The number of input observations at multiple time steps should be large
    enough to cover all possible wind directions because this function outputs
    roughness lengths that are smoothed within a given window of wind
    directions at 1-degree step. The default size of wind direction window for
    smoothing is 45-degree.

    The implementation is based on a MATLAB script originally by Jakob Sievers
    (05/2013) but revised and annotated by Christian Wille.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zm : ndarray of shape (n_obs,)
        List of measurement height (meter) per observation at one time step.

    ws : ndarray of shape (n_obs,)
        List of wind speed (m*s^-1) per observation at one time step.

    wd : ndarray of shape (n_obs,)
        List of wind direction (degree) per observation at one time step.

    ustar : ndarray of shape (n_obs,)
        List of friction velocity (m*s^-1) per observation at one time step.

    mo_len : ndarray of shape (n_obs,)
        List of Monin-Obukhov length (meter) per observation at one time step. 

    half_wd_win : float
        Half window size of wind directions to smooth estimates of roughness
        length per each 1-degree wind direction. Therefore, the minimum half
        window size allowed is 1 degree. No smoothing if a half window size
        less than 1 degree is given.

    Returns
    -------

    The implementation is based on a MATLAB script originally by Jakob Sievers
    (05/2013) but revised and annotated by Christian Wille.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zm : float
        The measurement/receptor height (meter) above zero displacement plane. 

    z0 : float
        The roughness length (meter).

    ws : float
        The wind speed (m*s^-1).

    ustar : float 
        The friction velocity (m*s^-1).

    mo_len : float
        The Monin-Obukhov length (meter). 

    sigma_v : float
        The standard deviation of cross-wind (m*s^-1).

    grid_domain : array-like of shape (4,)
        The rectangular domain of the grid on which the footprint will be
        estimated. The domain is defined by a bounding box [xmin, xmax, ymin,
        ymax] in meters, in a coordinate system with the measurement/receptor
        at the location given by the parameter `mxy` within the `grid_domain`.
        The `[xmin, ymax]` will be the upper left corner of the upper left cell
        in the output grid.  The X and Y directions of this coordinate system
        are set up in one the following two ways.
        
        If wind direction is given by the optional parameter `wd`, the grid will
        be set up to align with the X-Y axes where wind direction is measured
        (clockwise from positive Y, that is, similar to how azimuth angle is
        measured). For example, if wind direction is measured with regard to
        true/due north. Then the output grid will align with the X axis from
        west towards east and the Y axis from south towards north. 

        If no wind direction is given, the output grid aligns with along-wind
        and cross-wind direction.  Specifically in this coordinate system, the
        X axis points to the wind direction angle (where wind comes from, i.e.,
        positive X indicates upwind distances), then the Y axis is defined as
        perpendicular to the wind direction (i.e., cross-wind direction) and
        with the Y axis direction chosen to produce right-handed coordinates. 
        
    grid_res : float
        The resolution (meter) of the grid on which the footprint will be
        estimated. 

    mxy : array-like of shape (2,)
        The [x, y] of the measurement/receptor in the coordinate system of
        `grid_domain`. 

    wd : float
        The wind direction (degree), an angle where wind comes from. It is
        measured clockwise with regard to the Y axis of a cardinal coordinate
        system. The output grid of flux footprint will align with the axes of
        this coordinate system. 

        If you want the output grid to align with a pre-defined raster grid,
        you have to provide an adjusted wind direction angle that is with
        regard to the positive Y or north of this pre-defined grid system. That
        is, you need to change common wind direction angles based on true north
        to an adjusted value based on grid north. True north and grid north are
        usually not the same in many map projections where raster grids are
        defined. The difference between true north and grid north is called
        "meridian convergence" of a map projection. It depends on geolocation
        and map projection. 

    Returns
    -------
    grid_x : ndarray of shape (grid_ysize, grid_xsize)
        The X coordinates of cell centers of the grid on which flux footprint
        is estimated. The `grid_ysize` and `grid_xsize` are the number of cells
        along X and Y axes, that is, columns and rows. 

    grid_y : ndarray of shape (grid_ysize, grid_xsize)
        The Y coordinates of cell centers of the grid on which flux footprint
        is estimated. The `grid_ysize` and `grid_xsize` are the number of cells
        along X and Y axes, that is, columns and rows. 

    grid_ffm : ndarray of shape (grid_ysize, grid_xsize)
        The flux footprint, phi(x, y, z) in (Kormann and Meixner, 2001) that
        describes the flux portion (m^-2) seen by the measurement/receptor. The
        `grid_ysize` and `grid_xsize` are the number of cells along X and Y
        axes, that is, columns and rows.
